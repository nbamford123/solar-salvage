## To Do

* setup Netlify actions to run a build at midnight MWF
* create a contact form-- a mailto is just too dangerous for spam harvesting
* read and set up disqus comment policy, etc.
* check it against lighthouse and whatever-- secure? performant?
* notes for pilot pages, at least a little description on the first and last pages?
* search code for to-do
* google ads? Webcomic ads?
* tests?
* real 404 page
* SEO? Does that even matter for us?
* look up resources for listing/promoting web comics, and do so
* delete version from the duck
* update README
* put a footer in about "built with gatsby and arwes"?
