Plasma is just another name for atoms that have been torn apart, just a bunch of electrons and protons running amok.

Protons love electrons, and will to steal them away from any source they can find. Like the metal from a spaceship's hull.

This will ionize the hull, giving it a net positive charge.

Electrons love a positive charge, and will jump to it given any opportunity. They will do so quickly, even violently, if there are enough of them.

This is also known as lightning.

Jupiter is famous for it.
