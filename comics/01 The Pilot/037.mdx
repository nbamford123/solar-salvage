Lagrange points are places where the gravity between two or more bodies cancels each other out, producing a stable orbit. They are also called gravity wells, as they collect and hold passing matter much like a pit in the ground collects rainwater. Asteroids captured at these points are typically called “Trojans”.
Jupiter's Lagrange points hold thousands of asteroids, as that massive giant has equally massive wells.

The funny thing is that the wells are so big that it catches rocks in its forward L4 orbit (the Trojans) and the after L5 orbit, which are called “Greeks.” Two warring camps from the Iliad, gathered by a Roman god.

But it was recently discovered that good ol' Earth is capable of catching an asteroid of it's own, as [the first Earth Trojan](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/07/1107128-trojan-asteroid-earth-planet-orbit-nasa-space-science/). Exciting news, as this asteroid acts like Earth's wingman as we orbit the sun.

Probably not a bad place to visit some day.
