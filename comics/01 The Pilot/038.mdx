And this monumental asteroid mining facility marks the end of Act I for our story.

Asteroid mining is the great financial promise of space exploration. While scientists might be intrigued by alien life, what's most likely to pay the bills are the huge chunks of ore just floating out there, waiting for someone to scoop them up.

With no weather, seismic activity, and minimal gravity, it may well be that simple.

[NASA already has plans](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/08/16/scitech/main20093107.shtml?tag=mncol%3Blst%3B1) to do such a thing: send a probe to an asteroid, scoop up some dirt, and head home. All without landing.

Here's to future prospects and prospecting.
